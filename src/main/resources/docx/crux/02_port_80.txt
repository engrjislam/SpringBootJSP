error:
------
Apache shutdown unexpectedly on port 80 (default).


background:
-----------
I normally access MySQL database using phpMyAdmin which runs by apache in XAMPP. XAMPP is
used to access and control 'Apache MySQL PHP'. Generally apache in XAMPP is configured on
port 80 as default port. Some other application wants to share same port (i.e 80). Then
apache in XAMPP couldn't run on port 80.


solution:
---------
This could be solved by changing port from 80 to any unused port (like 8086, 8080 is embed
port for tomcat which is used by this project 'SpringBootJSP'). Port 80 was changed by 8086
as -

in 'httpd.conf':
________________
[find a line in 'Listen 80' and put 8086 in place of 80 or simply comment
'Listen 80' and add 'Listen 8086'] -

#Listen 80
Listen 8086

also find 'ServerName localhost:80' and comment 'ServerName localhost:80' line and add
'ServerName localhost:8086' as follows -

#ServerName localhost:80
ServerName localhost:8086

in 'httpd-ssl.conf':
____________________
Port 443 is used by Skype [find a line in 'Listen 443' and put 4433 in place of 443 or simply comment
'Listen 443' and add 'Listen 4433'] -

#Listen 443
Listen 4433

also find '<VirtualHost _default_:443>' and comment '<VirtualHost _default_:443>' line and add
following lines -

#<VirtualHost _default_:443>
<VirtualHost _default_:4433>
ServerName localhost:4433

accessing 'phpMyAdmin' and 'MySQL':
